# OmegaMHCounter

## Purpose
I am trying to evaluate raylib for a game idea i have. Instead of start at some point and evaluating raylib while working on the game this is how i am going to check it out. 

I have a different channel i just upload MonsterHunter Wilds gameplay. I was and still am a GreatSword main, but i wanted to learn other weapon. So i started playing other weapons.. DUH!!!
I want to remind myself to switch weapons every 5 hunts. At the moment i am just counting on a piece of paper and when i see 5 lines i switch weapons. 

But i am a developer. So why the heck i am using piece of paper when i can invest my time to make a software to do the counting. LOL!!!

so here we are.. i am making a counter app using raylib. 

## Dependencies

* Raylib v5.5
